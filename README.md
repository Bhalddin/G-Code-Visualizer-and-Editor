G-Code-Visualizer-and-Editor
============================

About the Project:
The G-Code Visualizer and Editor is a program designed to work with and edit G-code files often used with CNCs, Laser Cutters and 3D printers. (To learn more about the G-code file format: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code )

Currently, it allows user to load a G-code file. The program uses the cuts described in the G-code to recreate the original drawing, which is displayed in an image box. It then allows the user to add text of varying sizes on the drawing, which are saved into an updated G-Code.

Future Improvements:
This list is but is but a small collection of the vast possibilities of future improvements to be made to this project. 

•  Automatically detect drill bit size based on spacing between rows of cuts.
•	Develop a better way to generate the texts for the cuts rather than being hardcoded in
•	Add function to allow for curves in the text
•	Create a better more fluid user interface
•	Add it other editing features beyond text. Such as shapes, imported images, SVG files.
•	Create better editing options such as snaps, constraints, and dimensions that would allow the user to be more precise in their editing 
•	Allow user to select the depth of the text engraving
•	Improve the visualizing aspect of the program; perhaps add functionality of viewing file in 3D rather than just a 2D view.
•	Right now, the program is mostly targeted towards cutting machines (CNC, laser cutter); add features to allow editing for 3D printer G-code. 
•	Add option to cut out the outside of text rather than engraving it into the material
